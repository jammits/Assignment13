# Assignment13
 
For this assignment you will be implementing some more of the Online Bank functionality.

The source code from which you should start building can be found via https://github.com/tp02ga/java-bootcamp/tree/master/Assignment13

Modify the /users endpoint
Once you have this code checked out, your task will be to enhance the /users endpoint to allow the userId values to be clickable.

When clicked on, this will send a GET request to the /users/{userId} endpoint

Here’s what the /users page should look like:

Note: The accounts should be clickable too, but you can do that at the end of the assignment once you’ve created the /users/{userId}/accounts/{accountId} endpoint.
